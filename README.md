ghostwriter
===========

tooling to fuck with @errantspark's [ghost.life](https://ghost.life) project.

Please be sure to use Python3!

## toolz

`ghostwriter.py` - currently will send grayscale bitmap data from `img.jpg` in the same working dir to ghost.life
`ghostreader.py` - connects to ghost.life websocket and can preview pixel events in grayscale in a pygame context
